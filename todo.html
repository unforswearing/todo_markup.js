<h1>todo.tdx test file</h1><p /><p /><h2>General Information</h2><p /><p /><p /><p /><p />regular notes look like this. they will be marked as "TEXT" by the parser. this note can be one long line or a series of individual lines. the point is that notes do not have a special operator preceeding the text like the other formatting options. <p /><p />todo_markup.js is for taking notes quickly during meetings or conferences, when there is only time to open a txt file or Google Doc (instead of juggling multiple apps). to keep things simple todo_markup.js does not have nested tasks, reminders, or calendar integration. <p /><p /><h2>Task States</h2><p /><p />two task "states" instead of three: active an done. any line of text could become a todo item by prepending ! or x<p /><p />a few sample tasks:<p /><p /><input type="checkbox"> let georgia know that i will be late on monday </input><p /><p /><mark>an exclamation mark "!" prepended to the task indicates the task is in progress.</mark><p /><p /><input type="checkbox"> talk to steve about <a href="https://www.example.com">https://www.example.com</a></input><p /><p /><mark>tasks can include urls, which are indicated using the caret operator. urls can be placed anywhere in the line. </mark><p /><p /><input type="checkbox"> don't forget steve's birthday! </input><p /><p />completed tasks are indicated with an "x". these tasks are done:<p /><p />
